<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Welcome to my portfolio! This is my first website project. I can do anything needed to be done. I enjoy outside work, coding, and editing pictures. When I get home the first thing I do is listen to some music. I personally fancy older music, but I don't judge.</p>
<p>I can make games, websites, I can edit photos or videos if/whenever you may need it.</p>
<h2>Here's some stuff I like!</h2>
<dt><strong>1.</strong><i><u><strong>Music</strong></u></i></dt>

<dd>The way I connect to music is unexplainable.</dd><img src="images/musicvinalrecord.jpg" alt="Vinal Record" width="350" border="2">
<dt><strong>2.</strong><i><u><strong>Games</strong></u></i></dt>

<dd>Video or Board, doesn't matter, I'm up for anything.</dd><img src="images/videogamescharacters.jpg" alt="Video game characters." width="350" border="2">
<dt><strong>3.</strong><i><u><strong>Guitar</strong></u></i></dt>

<dd>While I think this could fall into the music category, it's different when I'm the one playing, feeling more connected then ever.</dd><img src="images/musickurtcobainjagstang.jpg" alt="Kurt Cobain Jag-Stang" width="350" border="2">
